        <p>Touché is an application aimed at making "just work" every key on your keyboard.
It's still in heavy development stage, and therefore is missing lots of stuff, but it's already usable.
The current "reference" keyboard is mine, a "Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 3000".
The "standard" special keys, like "Media Play", or "Volume Up" do work out of the box on every GNU/Linux distribution, 
but other keys, like "ZoomIn/Out", and the "1-2-3-4-5-*" keys in the upper part don't. Instead they send an event to /dev/usb/hiddev0.
Touché does detect these events, and allows you to transform them to known X key symbols, or to execute arbitrary commands.
Support for new keyboards should be easly added, the application does print the events when they're sent, so they can be added in a ney "keyboard database" entry.</p>

<p>Touché is released under GPLv3 license (included in the COPYING file)</p>

<hr><ul>
<li>Install Instructions:
*** Update: you don't really need to follow the instructions below.
*** Now you can find the script "scripts/compile" that automatically compiles and installs the application
*** Run "./scripts/compile --help" to see usage and options</li>
</ul><p>First you need to build the static library, and install it to a temporary location.
Then you can choose between the Qt GUI (simpler) and the KDE GUI (much more beautiful, using KDE styles and color settings).</p>

<h1>Core library:</h1>

<p>mkdir Touché_Core.build
cd Touché_Core.build
qmake ../Touché_Core
make install # it will only install the static library to /tmp, to allow compiling of the main application</p>

<h1>Configuration GUI:</h1>

<p>mkdir Touché_Configuration.build
cd Touché_Configuration.build
qmake ../Touché_Configuration
make install</p>

<h1>Qt GUI:</h1>

<p>mkdir ../Touché.build
cd ../Touché.build
qmake ../Touché
make install # this will install both the binary and its required dependencies, like udev rule for permissions and keyboard database.</p>

<h1>KDE GUI:</h1>

<p>mkdir ../Touché-kde.build
cd ../ Touché-kde.build
qmake ../Touché-kde
make install</p>

<ul>
<li>Configuration:
The application bindings are now fully configurable in a user interface accessible from tray icon.
Just right click the little "keyboard" icon in your system tray, then click your device name.
There is also a sample configuration file in Touché/files/samples_config/.
Just copy it in the this path:
$HOME/.config/GuLinux/Touché.conf</li>
</ul><p>Inside you can find some configuration examples. Just follow the pattern: the key names are in the keyboard database file ( /usr/share/Touché/keyboard_database.json )
You can now also use a "local" keyboard database, which can be installed in /home/marco/.config/GuLinux/keyboard_database.json and overrides the system one, if present. It comes handy if you wanna try adding support for a new keyboard.</p>

<p>*** Important note: with the installation comes also a udev rule, which by default is installed in /etc/udev/rules.d/ and assigns the /dev/usb/hiddev* devices to the group "users".
--- If this group is present in your distribution, your user must belong to this group to use Touché.
--- If this group is not present in your distribution, just change the udev rule to match an existing group.</p>
