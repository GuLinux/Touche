{"name":"Touché","body":"Touché is an application aimed at making \"just work\" every key on your keyboard.\r\nIt's still in heavy development stage, and therefore is missing lots of stuff, but it's already usable.\r\nThe current \"reference\" keyboard is mine, a \"Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 3000\".\r\nThe \"standard\" special keys, like \"Media Play\", or \"Volume Up\" do work out of the box on every GNU/Linux distribution, \r\nbut other keys, like \"ZoomIn/Out\", and the \"1-2-3-4-5-*\" keys in the upper part don't. Instead they send an event to /dev/usb/hiddev0.\r\nTouché does detect these events, and allows you to transform them to known X key symbols, or to execute arbitrary commands.\r\nSupport for new keyboards should be easly added, the application does print the events when they're sent, so they can be added in a ney \"keyboard database\" entry.\r\n\r\nTouché is released under GPLv3 license (included in the COPYING file)\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* Install Instructions:\r\n*** Update: you don't really need to follow the instructions below.\r\n*** Now you can find the script \"scripts/compile\" that automatically compiles and installs the application\r\n*** Run \"./scripts/compile --help\" to see usage and options\r\n\r\nFirst you need to build the static library, and install it to a temporary location.\r\nThen you can choose between the Qt GUI (simpler) and the KDE GUI (much more beautiful, using KDE styles and color settings).\r\n\r\n# Core library: \r\nmkdir Touché_Core.build\r\ncd Touché_Core.build\r\nqmake ../Touché_Core\r\nmake install # it will only install the static library to /tmp, to allow compiling of the main application\r\n\r\n# Configuration GUI:\r\nmkdir Touché_Configuration.build\r\ncd Touché_Configuration.build\r\nqmake ../Touché_Configuration\r\nmake install\r\n\r\n# Qt GUI: \r\nmkdir ../Touché.build\r\ncd ../Touché.build\r\nqmake ../Touché\r\nmake install # this will install both the binary and its required dependencies, like udev rule for permissions and keyboard database.\r\n\r\n# KDE GUI:\r\nmkdir ../Touché-kde.build\r\ncd ../ Touché-kde.build\r\nqmake ../Touché-kde\r\nmake install\r\n\r\n\r\n* Configuration:\r\nThe application bindings are now fully configurable in a user interface accessible from tray icon.\r\nJust right click the little \"keyboard\" icon in your system tray, then click your device name.\r\nThere is also a sample configuration file in Touché/files/samples_config/.\r\nJust copy it in the this path:\r\n  $HOME/.config/GuLinux/Touché.conf\r\n\r\nInside you can find some configuration examples. Just follow the pattern: the key names are in the keyboard database file ( /usr/share/Touché/keyboard_database.json )\r\nYou can now also use a \"local\" keyboard database, which can be installed in /home/marco/.config/GuLinux/keyboard_database.json and overrides the system one, if present. It comes handy if you wanna try adding support for a new keyboard.\r\n\r\n*** Important note: with the installation comes also a udev rule, which by default is installed in /etc/udev/rules.d/ and assigns the /dev/usb/hiddev* devices to the group \"users\".\r\n--- If this group is present in your distribution, your user must belong to this group to use Touché.\r\n--- If this group is not present in your distribution, just change the udev rule to match an existing group.\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Touché - Special keys recognizer for GNU/Linux, written in Qt","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
