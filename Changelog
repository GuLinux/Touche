  Initial release. Here there are the main highlights:
    * Catch input event from /dev/usb/hiddevX, otherwise ignored by the system.
    * Json Devices Database: pretty easy syntax for adding new devices.
    * Both Qt (simpler) and KDE (stilish) main applications are supported.
    * Fully configurable by a simple user interface.
    * Provides an udev rule to easly fix permissions on your usb devices.
    * Automatically configures xmodmap to bind your unrecognized keys.
    * Full support for Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 3000 (a.k.a. Microsoft Wireless Destkop 3000);
      possibly similar variants too.
    * Support for Apple IR remotes (old MacBook pro tested); there are different variants,
      two of them are configured right now.
