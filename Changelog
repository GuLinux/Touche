  0.3: KDE Only version
    * Port to KDE
    * Added Wiimote support
    * Fixed various bugs related to profiles
    * Fallback Profile: if an action is not defined in current profile, and it is defined in "Default" profile, this one will be executed.
    * Added global shortcuts for actions, mainly "Next Profile", "Connect Wiimote"
    * Splitted keyboard_database.json in multiple files, much better to maintain.
    * Moved config file and keyboard databases into default KDE locations
    * Moved "Profiles" settings to a generic configuration dialog
    * Added a "Modules" section for enabling modules different than hiddev (currently wiimote)
    * Refactoring to allow building generic input modules (like wiimote)

  0.2: New major release
    * Ported build system to CMake
    * Added profiles, to have different bindings for the same keys
    * Major code cleanup, allowing to add more engines (next one probably will be Wiimote)
    * Cleaning up desktop file and appName (fixing some issues with encoding)
    * Binding keypress and keyrelease events on "Translate to key" dialog
    * Added "aliases" in keyboard database, so now different device version can be mapped to the same key (example: apple remote)

  Build and desktop fixes only.
    * Make build more reliable.
    * Desktop file fixed for kdeinit launch error.
    * Use of kuniqueapplication in release mode (no need for multiple instances).
    * Fix crash when removing a device with configuration dialog open.
    * Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 3000: added "F-Block" key mapping.

  Initial release. Here there are the main highlights:
    * Catch input event from /dev/usb/hiddevX, otherwise ignored by the system.
    * Json Devices Database: pretty easy syntax for adding new devices.
    * Both Qt (simpler) and KDE (stilish) main applications are supported.
    * Fully configurable by a simple user interface.
    * Provides an udev rule to easly fix permissions on your usb devices.
    * Automatically configures xmodmap to bind your unrecognized keys.
    * Full support for Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 3000 (a.k.a. Microsoft Wireless Destkop 3000);
      possibly similar variants too.
    * Support for Apple IR remotes (old MacBook pro tested); there are different variants,
      two of them are configured right now.
