* Install Instructions:
mkdir Touché_staticlib.build Touché.build
cd Touché_staticlib.build
qmake ../Touché_staticlib
make install # it will only install the static library to /tmp, to allow compiling of the main application
cd ../Touché.build
qmake ../Touché
make install # this will install both the binary and its required dependencies, like udev rule for permissions and keyboard database.

* Configuration:
Currently there is no gui for configuration. Hopefully it will be added soon enough :)
There is a sample configuration file in Touché/files/samples_config/.
Just copy it in the this path:
  $HOME/.config/GuLinux/Touché.conf

Inside you can find some configuration examples. Just follow the pattern: the key names are in the keyboard database file ( /usr/share/Touché/keyboard_database.json )
