Touché is an application aimed at making "just work" every key on your keyboard.
It's still in heavy development stage, and therefore is missing lots of stuff, but it's already usable.
The current "reference" keyboard is mine, a "Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 3000".
The "standard" special keys, like "Media Play", or "Volume Up" do work out of the box on every GNU/Linux distribution, 
but other keys, like "ZoomIn/Out", and the "1-2-3-4-5-*" keys in the upper part don't. Instead they send an event to /dev/usb/hiddev0.
Touché does detect these events, and allows you to transform them to known X key symbols, or to execute arbitrary commands.
Support for new keyboards should be easly added, the application does print the events when they're sent, so they can be added in a ney "keyboard database" entry.

* Install Instructions:
mkdir Touché_staticlib.build Touché.build
cd Touché_staticlib.build
qmake ../Touché_staticlib
make install # it will only install the static library to /tmp, to allow compiling of the main application
cd ../Touché.build
qmake ../Touché
make install # this will install both the binary and its required dependencies, like udev rule for permissions and keyboard database.

* Configuration:
Currently there is no gui for configuration. Hopefully it will be added soon enough :)
There is a sample configuration file in Touché/files/samples_config/.
Just copy it in the this path:
  $HOME/.config/GuLinux/Touché.conf

Inside you can find some configuration examples. Just follow the pattern: the key names are in the keyboard database file ( /usr/share/Touché/keyboard_database.json )
